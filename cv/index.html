        <ul>
            <li>Wrote a program in C which uses a given number of threads to compute the diagonal sums equal to a user requested number from a given grid in a separate text file</li>
            <li>From there the program takes every number not involved with a diagonal sum and removes it from the original grid and outputs it into an out text file</li>
            <li>The program also outputs how long the operation took down to the millionths place with the given number of threads</li>
